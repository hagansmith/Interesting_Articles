			<h1>Motivation: The Scientific Guide on How to Get and Stay Motivated</h1>
			<p>Motivation is a powerful, yet tricky beast. Sometimes it is really easy to get motivated, and you find yourself wrapped up in a whirlwind of excitement. Other times, it is nearly impossible to figure out how to motivate yourself and you're trapped in a death spiral of procrastination. This page contains the best ideas and most useful research on how to get and stay motivated.</p>

			<p>This isn't going to be some rah-rah, pumped-up motivational speech. (That's not my style.) Instead, we're going to break down the science behind how to get motivated in the first place and how to stay motivated for the long-run. Whether you're trying to figure out how to motivate yourself or how to motivate a team, this page should cover everything you need to know.</p>

			<h1>Creativity: How to Unlock Your Hidden Creative Genius</h1>
			
			<h4>Let's define creativity.</h4>

			<p>The creative process is the act of making new connections between old ideas or recognizing relationships between concepts. Creative thinking is not about generating something new from a blank slate, but rather about taking what is already present and combining those bits and pieces in a way that has not been done previously.</p>

			<p>While being creative isn't easy, nearly all great ideas follow a similar creative process. In 1940, an advertising executive named James Webb Young published a short guide titled, A Technique for Producing Ideas.</p>

			<h4>Young believed the process of creative connection always occurred in five steps.</h4>

			<h4>The Creative Process</h4>
			<ol>
			<li>Gather new material. At first, you learn. During this stage you focus on:
			 1) learning specific material directly related to your task and 
			 2) learning general material by becoming fascinated with a wide range of concepts.</li>
			<li>Thoroughly work over the materials in your mind. During this stage, you examine what you have learned by looking at the facts from different angles and experimenting with fitting various ideas together.</li>
			<li>Step away from the problem. Next, you put the problem completely out of your mind and go do something else that excites you and energizes you.</li>
			<li>Let your idea return to you. At some point, but only after you have stopped thinking about it, your idea will come back to you with a flash of insight and renewed energy.</li>
			<li>Shape and develop your idea based on feedback. For any idea to succeed, you must release it out into the world, submit it to criticism, and adapt it as needed.</li>
			</ol>

			<h1>The Productivity Guide: Time Management Strategies That Work</h1>
			<p>Let's define productivity. Productivity is a measure of efficiency of a person completing a task. We often assume that productivity means getting more things done each day. Wrong. Productivity is getting important things done consistently. And no matter what you are working on, there are only a few things that are truly important.</p>

			<p>Being productive is about maintaining a steady, average speed on a few things, not maximum speed on everything.</p>

			<p>Before we talk about how to get started, I wanted to let you know I researched and compiled science-backed ways to stick to good habits and stop procrastinating.</p>

			<h1>Life Lessons</h1>
			<p>One of the hardest things about improving your life is remembering to practice what you've learned in a moment of temptation, frustration, or hardship. Anyone can follow a strategy as they read about it, but remembering to stick with it in the real world is tough.

			Stories help with that. An engaging story sticks with you in a way that a research finding often can't. While JamesClear.com promotes science-backed ideas, we don't shun stories and lessons based on real life.

			This page collects life lessons from my own life as well as from the lives of artists, creators, and innovators. Articles grapple with concepts like marriage, gratitude, and work-life balance.</p>
